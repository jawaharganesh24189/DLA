        "\n",
        "India faces a severe access to justice crisis:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Challenge | Statistics |\n",
        "|-----------|-----------|\n",
        "| **Population vs Lawyers** | 1.3 billion people with only ~1.7 million lawyers |\n",
        "| **Case Pendency** | Average 5-15 years in lower courts |\n",
        "| **Pending Cases** | 3.5 crore (35 million) cases across Indian courts |\n",
        "| **Cost** | Legal consultation prohibitive for rural/low-income citizens |\n",
        "| **Language Barriers** | 22+ official languages create communication gaps |\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Limited Legal Awareness**: Most Indians don't know their basic legal rights\n",
        "- **Cost Barriers**: Initial legal consultation costs ₹2,000-10,000+\n",
        "- **Time**: Weeks to get appointment with lawyers in major cities\n",
        "- **Rural Access**: Lawyer availability very limited outside urban areas\n",

        "\n",
        "**⚖️ THIS SYSTEM PROVIDES INFORMATION, NOT LEGAL ADVICE**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What This System IS:\n",
        "✅ An educational tool for learning about Indian laws  \n",
        "✅ A search engine for legal information  \n",
        "✅ A starting point for understanding your rights  \n",
        "✅ A guide to help you ask better questions to lawyers  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### What This System IS NOT:\n",
        "❌ A substitute for a qualified lawyer  \n",
        "❌ Legal advice for your specific situation  \n",
        "❌ A tool for making legal decisions  \n",
        "❌ A replacement for professional legal consultation  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Critical Understanding\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Using this system does not create any attorney-client relationship or privilege.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Educational Purpose Only**: All information is for educational purposes and general awareness about Indian laws.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fact-Specific Nature**: Legal outcomes depend heavily on specific facts, evidence, jurisdiction, and current law. This system provides general information only.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Laws Change**: Indian laws are amended regularly. Information may become outdated.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Jurisdictional Variations**: Laws and procedures vary by state in India (e.g., property laws, local regulations).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **No Liability**: Creators assume NO liability for actions taken based on AI-generated information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When You MUST Consult a Lawyer\n",
        "\n",
        "🚨 **Immediately consult a qualified lawyer if:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Criminal Matters**: Any criminal charge, FIR, arrest, investigation\n",
        "- **Court Proceedings**: You need to file a case or defend yourself\n",
        "- **Large Financial Stakes**: Property disputes, business matters, inheritance\n",
        "- **Time-Sensitive**: Limitation periods running out, urgent legal action needed\n",
        "- **Rights at Risk**: Personal liberty, custody, deportation, property loss\n",
        "- **Complex Situations**: Multiple laws, unclear facts, precedent interpretation\n",
        "- **Serious Consequences**: Imprisonment, heavy fines, loss of rights\n",

        "### Ethical AI Principles\n",

        "2. **Accuracy**: Based on real legal principles (with synthetic demo data)\n",
        "3. **Accessibility**: Making legal information available to all\n",
        "4. **Safety**: Always recommending professional consultation\n",
        "5. **Privacy**: Not storing personal information\n",
        "6. **Non-Discrimination**: Equal access regardless of background\n",
        "7. **Harm Prevention**: Warnings for sensitive matters\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations of This System\n",
