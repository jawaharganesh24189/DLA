In the break room
Emma walks in looking stressed
Emma: Has anyone seen the client proposal?
Tom: I think it's on your desk.
Note: The proposal was due yesterday
Emma: Oh no, I need to review it ASAP!
Tom offers to help
Tom: I can help you go through it.
Emma: That would be amazing, thank you!
They work together to review the document
Tom: This section needs more detail.
Emma: You're right. I'll add some examples.
After some time passes
Tom: I think we're done. This looks much better.
Emma: I couldn't have done it without you.
