Attack on Titan - Season 1 Script

[Episode 1: To You, After 2000 Years]

NARRATOR: That day, humanity received a grim reminder. We lived in fear of the Titans, and were disgraced to live in these cages we called walls.

EREN: I'm going to destroy them! Every last one of those animals that's on this Earth!

MIKASA: Eren, calm down.

EREN: How can I calm down? They broke through Wall Maria! They destroyed everything!

ARMIN: Eren's right. We can't stay here anymore. We have to fight back.

CARLA: Eren, Mikasa! Get away from here! Run!

EREN: Mom! No!

MIKASA: Eren, we have to go now!

[Episode 2: That Day]

INSTRUCTOR SHADIS: You are now cadets! For the next three years, you will train to become soldiers!

EREN: I will join the Survey Corps and kill every Titan!

JEAN: You're insane, Jaeger. The Survey Corps has the highest mortality rate.

EREN: I don't care. I'm not going to live my life cowering behind walls.

MIKASA: Where Eren goes, I go.

ARMIN: We'll all join together. We can make a difference.

[Episode 3: A Dim Light Amid Despair]

EREN: This vertical maneuvering equipment is amazing!

ARMIN: You're a natural at this, Eren.

MIKASA: Focus on your balance and timing.

INSTRUCTOR SHADIS: Jaeger! You're all over the place! Get control!

EREN: I can't... something's wrong with my equipment!

ARMIN: Eren, wait!

[Episode 4: The Night of the Closing Ceremony]

EREN: Finally, we graduate tomorrow.

JEAN: So, Jaeger, you still planning on joining the suicide squad?

EREN: The Survey Corps isn't a suicide squad. They're humanity's best hope.

MARCO: Everyone has their own reasons for fighting.

SASHA: I just want to make sure there's food for everyone.

CONNIE: Simple goals are the best goals.

REINER: We all have our duties to fulfill.

[Episode 5: First Battle]

EREN: A Titan! Right here in Trost!

ARMIN: The Colossal Titan... it's appeared again!

MIKASA: Eren, stay close!

EREN: We have to protect the city! Everyone, to your positions!

THOMAS: I'm scared, but I won't run!

EREN: That's the spirit! We can do this!

[Episode 6: The World That the Girl Saw]

MIKASA: When I was young, I lost everything. But then Eren saved me.

EREN: You're not a slave. You're not livestock. Fight!

MIKASA: That day, I saw the cruelty of the world. But I also saw its beauty.

GRISHA: Mikasa, protect Eren. Always.

MIKASA: I will. I promise.

[Episode 7: Small Blade]

ARMIN: We're running out of gas!

EREN: We have to keep fighting! We can't give up!

MIKASA: Eren... where are you?

CONNIE: This is hopeless!

JEAN: No! We survive! That's what we do!

[Episode 8: Hearing the Heartbeat]

EREN: What... what am I?

ARMIN: Eren! You're alive!

MIKASA: Eren, you transformed into a Titan.

EREN: I became... a Titan?

ARMIN: You saved us all. You have the power to fight them.

EREN: Then I'll use this power to destroy every single Titan!

[Episode 9: Whereabouts of His Left Arm]

COMMANDER PIXIS: Eren Jaeger, you possess a unique ability.

EREN: I don't fully understand it myself, sir.

COMMANDER PIXIS: Can you control this power?

EREN: I'll do whatever it takes to help humanity.

ARMIN: We believe Eren can seal the hole in Wall Rose.

COMMANDER PIXIS: Then that's what we'll do. Prepare for operation retake Trost!

[Episode 10: Response]

RICO: You think you can trust that monster?

IAN: We follow orders. Eren Jaeger is our key to victory.

MITABI: If he loses control, we eliminate him.

EREN: I understand the risk. I won't fail.

MIKASA: If anyone tries to harm Eren, they'll have to go through me.

ARMIN: We're all in this together.

[Episode 11: Icon]

EREN: I need to pick up that boulder and seal the gate.

ARMIN: You can do this, Eren!

MIKASA: Focus on the mission. Only the mission.

EREN: The boulder... it's so heavy!

RICO: He's not moving! The plan is failing!

IAN: Give him time! He can do this!

[Episode 12: Wound]

EREN: I... I did it! The gate is sealed!

ARMIN: Eren! You saved the city!

MIKASA: Let's get you out of there.

COMMANDER PIXIS: Well done, soldier. You've given humanity hope.

EREN: This is just the beginning. We'll take back Wall Maria next.

[Episode 13: Primal Desires]

ERWIN: Eren Jaeger, you will join the Survey Corps.

EREN: Yes, sir! It's an honor!

LEVI: Don't get cocky, brat. You're a liability until proven otherwise.

EREN: I'll prove myself, Captain Levi!

HANGE: Oh, this is exciting! A human who can turn into a Titan!

EREN: Um, who is this?

LEVI: That's Squad Leader Hange. Try not to encourage her.

[Episode 14: Still Can't See]

LEVI: You'll be joining my squad.

EREN: Your squad?

PETRA: We're Levi's special operations squad.

OLUO: We're the elite of the elite.

ELD: We'll keep you safe while you learn to control your power.

GUNTHER: But if you lose control, we'll kill you without hesitation.

EREN: I understand.

[Episode 15: Special Operations Squad]

HANGE: Eren! Let's run some experiments!

EREN: Experiments?

HANGE: I need to understand your Titan transformation!

LEVI: Don't kill him, Four-Eyes.

HANGE: I would never! Well... probably not.

EREN: This is going to hurt, isn't it?

MOBLIT: I'll document everything, Squad Leader!

[Episode 16: What Needs to be Done Now]

ERWIN: We're going on an expedition beyond the walls.

EREN: I'm ready, Commander.

ERWIN: Our objective is to reach Shiganshina and learn the truth about the Titans.

LEVI: Eren, you'll follow my orders exactly.

EREN: Yes, sir!

MIKASA: I'm coming too.

ARMIN: We all are.

[Episode 17: Female Titan]

ARMIN: There's something wrong. That Titan is different.

EREN: It's moving with purpose!

LEVI: It's heading right for us!

ARMIN: It's intelligent! It's the Female Titan!

EREN: I'll transform and fight it!

LEVI: No! Stick to the plan!

[Episode 18: Forest of Giant Trees]

LEVI: Keep moving forward!

EREN: Captain! Soldiers are dying!

LEVI: I said keep moving!

EREN: We have to help them!

PETRA: Trust the Captain, Eren!

EREN: But...

OLUO: This is an order!

[Episode 19: Bite]

EREN: I won't let anyone else die!

LEVI: Eren, no!

EREN: I'm transforming!

FEMALE TITAN: *roars*

EREN: I'll defeat you here and now!

[Episode 20: Erwin Smith]

ERWIN: The expedition was a failure.

LEVI: We lost good soldiers.

ERWIN: But we learned valuable information.

LEVI: At what cost?

ERWIN: The cost necessary for humanity's survival.

PETRA'S FATHER: Commander, where is my daughter?

LEVI: ...She died bravely in the line of duty.

[Episode 21: Crushing Blow]

EREN: I was useless! I couldn't save anyone!

LEVI: Listen up, brat. You made a choice. No one knows if it was right.

EREN: But they all died!

LEVI: Yes. And their deaths will have meaning only if we keep moving forward.

MIKASA: Eren, we're still here.

ARMIN: We'll fight together.

[Episode 22: The Defeated]

ANNIE: Hello, Eren.

EREN: Annie? What are you doing here?

ARMIN: Annie, I need your help with something.

ANNIE: What kind of help?

ARMIN: It's about the Female Titan.

ANNIE: ...I see.

[Episode 23: Smile]

ARMIN: Annie Leonhart, I believe you are the Female Titan.

ANNIE: That's quite an accusation, Armin.

EREN: Annie, please tell us it's not true.

MIKASA: If you are the enemy, I won't hesitate.

ANNIE: I'm sorry... I can't go on like this anymore.

EREN: Annie!

[Episode 24: Mercy]

ANNIE: I just wanted to go home.

EREN: Annie, why? Why did you do this?

ANNIE: You wouldn't understand. None of you would.

LEVI: Restrain her before she transforms!

ANNIE: It's too late!

[Episode 25: Wall]

EREN: Annie is trapped in the crystal. We can't get answers from her.

ARMIN: At least the threat is neutralized.

MIKASA: For now.

COMMANDER PYXIS: What's this? There's a Titan in the wall!

PASTOR NICK: You must not let the sunlight touch the wall!

HANGE: What are you hiding?

PASTOR NICK: The walls... they're made of Titans.

EREN: What?! The walls are made of Titans?

ARMIN: Then everything we knew was a lie.

MIKASA: What else don't we know?

LEVI: We'll find out. One way or another.

ERWIN: The truth is out there. Beyond the walls.

EREN: Then that's where we'll go. We'll find the truth and take back our world!
