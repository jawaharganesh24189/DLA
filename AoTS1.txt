[SCENE: Training Ground]
Eren: I'm going to destroy every last Titan! I'll kill them all!
Mikasa: Eren, you need to stay calm.
Armin: We need to work together if we're going to survive.

[SCENE: Wall Maria]
Eren: We have to take back Wall Maria. It's our home!
Mikasa: I'll protect you, Eren. Always.
Armin: But we need a plan. We can't just rush in blindly.

[SCENE: Battle]
Eren: Die, you monsters! I won't let you hurt anyone else!
Levi: Stay focused, brat. Don't let your emotions control you.
Eren: Yes, Captain!

[SCENE: Training]
Reiner: You have to be stronger than this, Eren.
Eren: I know! I'm trying my best!
Bertholdt: We all have our limits.

[SCENE: Strategy Meeting]
Armin: If we use the forest to our advantage, we can set a trap.
Eren: That's brilliant, Armin!
Mikasa: We should position our best fighters at key points.

[SCENE: Wall Rose]
Sasha: Food is running low. We need to secure more supplies.
Connie: I can help with that. My village had good farmland.
Jean: We need to focus on the mission first.

[SCENE: Emotional Moment]
Eren: Why... why did they have to die?
Mikasa: Because we weren't strong enough. Not yet.
Armin: But we can become stronger. We have to.

[SCENE: Training Ground]
Eren: I won't give up. Never!
Reiner: That's the spirit. Keep pushing yourself.
Annie: Technique matters more than raw determination.

[SCENE: Battle]
Levi: Don't hesitate. If you hesitate, you die.
Eren: I understand, sir!
Mikasa: I won't let anything happen to Eren.

[SCENE: Night Watch]
Armin: The stars are beautiful tonight.
Eren: We'll see them from beyond the walls someday.
Mikasa: As long as we're together.

[SCENE: Politics]
Erwin: We need to convince the council to support our expedition.
Levi: Those bureaucrats don't understand what's at stake.
Hange: Maybe we can show them our research on Titan behavior.

[SCENE: Training]
Eren: My ODM gear isn't responding properly!
Mikasa: Check your gas canisters. You might be running low.
Armin: And make sure your blades are sharp.

[SCENE: Titan Encounter]
Eren: There! A 15-meter class!
Levi: I'll handle this one. Watch and learn.
Eren: That speed... incredible!

[SCENE: Strategy]
Armin: We need to understand their weaknesses better.
Hange: That's why we capture them for study!
Eren: I'd rather just kill them all.

[SCENE: Emotional]
Mikasa: Promise me you'll come back alive.
Eren: I promise. We'll see the ocean together.
Armin: All three of us, just like we dreamed.

[SCENE: Training Ground]
Jean: You think you're so special, Eren?
Eren: This isn't about me. It's about humanity!
Reiner: Both of you, focus on training!

[SCENE: Wall]
Sasha: I miss my hometown cooking.
Connie: Me too. But we have a duty here.
Krista: We should all share a meal when this is over.

[SCENE: Battle Strategy]
Erwin: The operation will commence at dawn.
Levi: My squad will take the vanguard.
Hange: We've prepared all the equipment we need.

[SCENE: Reflection]
Eren: Sometimes I wonder if we can really win.
Mikasa: We will. We have to.
Armin: Knowledge is power. The more we learn, the better our chances.

[SCENE: Training]
Annie: Your form is sloppy. Focus on precision.
Eren: I'm trying to be faster!
Annie: Speed without control is useless.

[SCENE: Wall Rose]
Eren: We can't let them breach this wall too.
Jean: We'll hold them off, no matter what.
Marco: We're all counting on each other.

[SCENE: Night]
Armin: Did you hear that sound?
Mikasa: Stay alert. It could be anything.
Eren: I'm ready for whatever comes.

[SCENE: Planning]
Erwin: Success depends on everyone doing their part.
Levi: No one gets left behind.
Hange: Unless they're already dead!

[SCENE: Emotional Moment]
Eren: I failed them. I wasn't strong enough.
Mikasa: You did everything you could.
Armin: We learn from our mistakes and grow stronger.

[SCENE: Training]
Reiner: You're improving, Eren. Keep it up.
Eren: Thanks. I won't let you down.
Bertholdt: We should practice more formations.

[SCENE: Battle]
Eren: I won't run away! I'll fight!
Levi: Good. Fear is natural, but don't let it control you.
Mikasa: We fight together.

[SCENE: Strategy]
Armin: If we can predict their movements, we gain an advantage.
Hange: That's why observation is so important!
Erwin: Intelligence wins wars as much as strength.

[SCENE: Wall]
Sasha: I volunteer for the scouting mission.
Connie: I'm coming with you.
Jean: Someone needs to keep you two out of trouble.

[SCENE: Emotional]
Eren: Do you think we'll ever be free?
Armin: I believe so. We just have to keep fighting.
Mikasa: As long as we're alive, there's hope.

[SCENE: Training Ground]
Eren: Again! I need to practice this maneuver again!
Mikasa: Don't overdo it. Rest is important too.
Armin: Let me show you a different approach.

[SCENE: Mission Briefing]
Erwin: This expedition could change everything.
Levi: We've lost too many already. Let's make it count.
Hange: The potential discoveries are worth the risk!

[SCENE: Battle]
Eren: They just keep coming!
Mikasa: Stay focused on the weak point!
Levi: Conserve your gas and blades!

[SCENE: Aftermath]
Armin: We survived... but at what cost?
Eren: We honor them by continuing to fight.
Mikasa: Their sacrifice won't be forgotten.

[SCENE: Night Watch]
Jean: It's quiet tonight. Too quiet.
Marco: Maybe we're finally getting a break.
Eren: Or maybe it's the calm before the storm.

[SCENE: Training]
Annie: You rely too much on brute force.
Eren: Sometimes that's what's needed!
Reiner: Both approaches have merit.

[SCENE: Strategy Meeting]
Erwin: We need to think three steps ahead.
Armin: I've been analyzing their behavior patterns.
Hange: And I've been studying their biology!

[SCENE: Emotional]
Eren: I won't let fear control me anymore.
Mikasa: That's good. Fear makes mistakes.
Armin: But healthy caution keeps us alive.

[SCENE: Wall]
Sasha: Something feels different today.
Connie: Yeah, I feel it too.
Krista: We should report this to the commander.

[SCENE: Training Ground]
Eren: I'm finally getting the hang of this!
Mikasa: You're improving steadily.
Armin: Consistency is key in combat.

[SCENE: Battle Planning]
Levi: We strike fast and hard.
Eren: I'm ready, sir!
Mikasa: Formation positions confirmed.

[SCENE: Reflection]
Armin: The world is bigger than we thought.
Eren: And we're going to see all of it.
Mikasa: Together, always.
